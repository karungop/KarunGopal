        I'm a junior at The Ohio State University double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics.
        I'm currently a Software Engineering Intern at Principal Financial Group where I work on building scalable backend services.
        I'm passionate about backend architecture, developer tools, and applied AI.
        Outside of school, I build projects to deepen my understanding of systems and AI, and I love finding new ways to optimize my workflow and help others do the same.
